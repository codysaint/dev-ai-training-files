    "Linear regression is a machine learning method for prediction. In essence, if we are given training samples $(x_0, y_0), \\dots, (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})$, then linear regression produces a line $L$ that best approximates the points. The line $L$ can then be used to predict the values of new data: If $x_{n}$ is a new data point, then the predicted value for $y_{n}$ is the hight of $L$ over the point $x_{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let the $x$-values represent height of individuals (in cm), and let the $y$-values represent the weight of the individuals (in kg). Then a pair $(180, 80)$ represents a person that is 180cm high, and weights 80kg. The task of linear regression is, given many observed individuals $(x_0, y_0), \\dots, (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})$, to predict the weight $y_{n}$ of a new individual by only knowing the persons hight $x_{n}$.\n",
